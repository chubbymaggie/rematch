rematch
=======

REmatch, a simple binary diffing utility that just works.

At least, we hope it will be. Rematch is still a work in progress and is not
fully functional at the moment.  We're currently working on bringing up basic
functionality. Check us out again soon or watch for updates!

It is intended to be used by reverse engineers by revealing and identifying
previously reverse engineered similar functions and migrating documentation
and annotations to current IDB. It does that by locally collecting data about
functions in your IDB and uploading that information to a web service (which
you're supposed to set up as well). Upon request, the web service can match
your functions against all (or part) of previously uploaded functions and
provide matches.

A secondary goal of this (which is not currently pursued) is to allow
synchronization between multiple reverse engineers working on the same file.

Goal of REmatch
===============

The goal of REmatch is to act as a maintained, extendable, open source tool
for advanced assembly function-level binary comparison and matching.
Rematch will be a completely open source and free (as in speech)
community-driven tool. We support buttom-up organizational methods and desire
Rematch to be heavily influenced by it's users (both in decision making and
development).

We've noticed that although there are more than several existing binary
matching tools, there's no one tool that provides all of the following:

#. Open source and community driven.
#. Supports advanced matching algorithms (ML included â„¢).
#. Fully integrated into IDA.
#. Allows managing multiple projects in a single location.
#. Enables out of the box one vs. many matches.
#. Actively maintained.

Status updates
==============

We'll try to occasionally update here about what's going on in the project
and briefly describe advancements we've had.

Current status (June 16th, 2017)
-----------------------------------

Docker server deployment is now available, which is a milestone for us as it
makes running a rematch setup easier (and also makes sure everyone can run
their own server). Although good matches are not quite ready yet, this makes
rematch quite usable in the sense of users being able to use it.

Another important framework enhancement is the ability to apply annotations
collected form previous work, so successful matches are actually actionable.
Current available annoations include only function names and function
prototypes, however this is easily extendable by adding `Annotation <https://github.com/nirizr/rematch/blob/master/idaplugin/rematch/collectors/annotations/annotation.py>`_ classes, with only two functions. `NameAnnotation <https://github.com/nirizr/rematch/blob/master/idaplugin/rematch/collectors/annotations/name.py>`_ is such an example.  

Some smaller improvements include:

#. Documented small portions of the project (mostly installation and basic usage).
#. Some match results quality and performance improvements.
#. Some tests for the IDAPython plugin (using pytest-idapro).
#. Bug fixes along the way.

Next goals/improvements are going to be:

#. Adding more matching engines.
#. Adding some automation abilities to let us batch-scan IDBs and test match engines on large sets of files.

Old statuses

Old status paragraphs will be pushed here.

We recently got another big PR in, `Match results dialog
<https://github.com/nirizr/rematch/pull/17>`_, that ended up being more then
just implementing the match results dialog. It shows graphs of remote 
functions being matched, it has a python based scripting to filter the 
match results, it had quite a bit of speedup improvements to the matching
engine as well as fixing some related bugs. 
We also added the concept of "file version" as part of the architecture.
Additionally, we've added more matchers and more annotations ( with more 
coming on the way).
We had some major code quality improvements and improved the plugin and 
server installation process.

Our current goal is the first relase, which requires:

#. Basic documentation being in (partially done).
#. Server deployments using docker and easier installation (in progress).

And will optionally have:

#. Web interface for the server.
#. An achievements / score system. Yay gamification!

(November 9th, 2016)
++++++++++++++++++++

We recently got a big PR in, `implement match backend
<https://github.com/nirizr/rematch/pull/22>`_, that basically sets up the
foundations for matching functions (as well as some basic matching
functionality). It implements "collectors" (under
`idapython/rematch/collectors`) and "matchers" (under `server/collab/matches`)
which collect features and match functions based on those features
respectively. One of the goals here was to have adding additional matching
strategies and features as easy as possible.

There's no nice way to see the results of such comparisons but they're stored
in the database and the browsable API can be used to view them. Adding a
results dialog is the next big task. We have some basic match configuration
going on for the matching process such as which functions to match and against
what (there's a picture in the PR ticket). 

We also added quite a bit of minor changes (bug fixes, speedup and 
architecture improvements, richer UI).

(August 30th, 2016)
+++++++++++++++++++

Development advances on a daily basis. We have a basic server and an IDA
plugin. We collect a few relatively simple features and working on adding more.
We have a matching stab that we will populate soon. Features are uploaded to
the server. Basic plugin settings, project hierarchy and user authentication.
We have a skeleton for the match results dialog (which supports some basic
python scripting! :D).
